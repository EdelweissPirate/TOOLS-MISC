# CANVAS IMAGE SCALER

Works by reading array of temperatures (eg. tempVals_0.js) that are translated into colours chosen from a different array (tempColours.js)

These values get drawn onto a scaled offscreen canvas before being translated to the onscreen canvas

## SET CANVAS WIDTH AND HEIGHT TO DESIRED END SIZE IN INDEX.HTML

### EG. IMAGE IS 363 * 270 AND DESIRED TO BE SCALED 3 TIMES IT'S SIZE, CANVAS WIDTH = "1089" AND HEIGHT = "810"
